# 🎨 Creative_coding

A personal collection of my experimental, non-ML coding projects — where I explore ideas that are artistic, algorithmic, or just for fun.

## 📂 About This Repository

**`Creative_coding`** is where I keep coding projects that don’t fit directly under my Machine Learning, Data Science, or DSA practice work.  
It’s a sandbox for:
- Generative art 🧵✨
- Algorithmic visualizations
- Creative experiments with math and code
- Any quirky coding side quests

This repo keeps my portfolio balanced and showcases my curiosity beyond core ML/DS.

## ✅ Current Projects

### 1️⃣ String Art Generator  
A Python project that turns images into line-based string art using nail placement and simple line heuristics.  
Includes:
- Circle-based nail layout
- Customizable parameters
- Progress snapshots
- Total thread length estimate  
**Output:** Beautiful black-and-white generative string art you can make in real life.

> **Folder:** `string_art/`
